# Flocking-swarm-Algorithm
This is the code employed in my research for my Bachelor Degree (105/110) in Ingegneria Informatica triennale
 RELATOR: Mario C.G.A. Cimino
The code here is used with PX4-Autopilot simulator for testing and optmization of the drones swarm flight.   Therefore here it's proposed a Genethic Algorithm for the Flocking optimization by running it with experiment in open source simulator
